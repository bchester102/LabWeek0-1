Hey there, my name is **Bradley** and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at UCSD. I'm currently taking [CSE 110](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html), which is all about software engineering.

For the first assignment, we were tasked with making a profile about ourselves to get used to *Github* and *VSCode*. Screenshots of interacting with a Git repository can be seen [here](screenshots/terminal.png) and [here](screenshots/vscode.png).

Now to talk a little bit about myself:

### Programming Languages I know:
- Python
- Java
- C++

### Pizza topping rankings
1. Pepperoni
2. Sausage
3. Mushrooms

### Stuff I want to get out of this class
- [ ] Get experience working on a project with other
- [ ] Learn about the software engineering process
- [ ] Gain experience that can be put on a resume

I hope that I'll be able to learn a lot from this class and figure out what it means to be a software engineer. I will put my best foot forwarf and work my hardest to learn, going by a quote from one of my past professors:
> "Start early, start often"
